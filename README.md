# Mesh Data Structure

Starting point of the second semester course on PDE's. This code contains some useful implementations of several data strcutures for a finite element mesh in C++.

## Getting started

Test out the mesh features by `mkdir` a build directory and `cmake .. && make`. Write your tests in `main.cpp`. Once you are done you can execute `./Mesh`. Two meshes are already provided in `.msh` format, they should stay where they currently are.
